# Sharing Images

## Requirements

Have at least one image locally (run `podman image ls` to confirm).<br>
If you don't have images locally, run simply `podman pull httpd`.

## Objectives

1. Choose an image and create an archive out of it
2. Check the archive size. Is it different than the image size? If yes, what's the difference? If not, why?
3. Copy the generated archive to a remote host 
4. Load the image
5. Verify it was loaded and exists on the remote host
