## Cloud Slack Bot

Create a slack bot to manage cloud instances. You can choose whatever cloud provider you want (e.g. Openstack, AWS, GCP, Azure)
You should provide:

  * Instructions on how to use it
  * Source code of the slack bot
  * A running slack bot account or a deployment script so we can test it

The bot should be able to support:

  * Creating new instances
  * Removing existing instances
  * Starting an instance
  * Stopping an instance
  * Displaying the status of an instance
  * List all available instances

The bot should also be able to show help message.
