## AWS ELB - ALB Multiple Target Groups

### Requirements                   

Two EC2 instances with a simple web application that shows the web page with the string "Hey, it's a me, `<HOSTNAME>`!"
One EC2 instance with a simple web application that shows the web page with the string "Hey, it's only a test..." under the endpoint /test

### Objectives

1. Create an application load balancer for the two instances you have, with the following properties
  1. healthy threshold: 3
  2. unhealthy threshold: 3
  3. interval: 10 seconds
2. Create another target group
  1. Traffic should be forwarded to this group based on the "/test" path
