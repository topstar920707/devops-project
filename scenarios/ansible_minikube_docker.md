## Ansible, Minikube and Docker

* Write a simple program in any language you want that outputs "I'm on <HOSTNAME>"
* Write a Dockerfile which will run your app
* Create the YAML files required for deploying the pods
* Write and run an Ansible playbook which will install Docker, Minikube and kubectl and then create a deployment in minikube with your app running.
