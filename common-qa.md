## Q&A

### What is the purpose of repository?

To learn, of course :)
Or more specifically:

* Measure your knowledge
* Help you prepare to interviews
* Simply learning something new :)

### Are these real DevOps interview questions?

Well, first of all, most of the questions in this repo aren't really DevOps questions. They are operational, development, HR, ... questions. Probably less than 3% percentage are actual DevOps questions but whether we like it or not, some DevOps interviews (or most) include them and this is why they are included in this repository.

There are many versions of DevOps interviews today. Some will include questions like in this project while other versions can be for example merely on your C.V and will not include even one question from this repository.

Also, "coding-operational-HR-...-interview-questions" is too long name for a repository.

### Should I be familiar with all the tools/platforms/... listed in this repository?

NO NO NO! :)
I won't give you the crap of "DevOps is a culture, not a role" kind of stuff but one thing is for sure, DevOps is not about being familiar with all the existing tools.

With that being said, there are some concepts, tools, platforms, ... that are quite common in jobs requirements. Take Linux for example, while Linux is not part of 100% of DevOps roles out there, it's still quite a desired skill and probably appear as a requirement in more than 80% of DevOps roles if I had to guess. So go learn some Linux ;)

### How should I prepare for my DevOps interview?

Excellent question. This repository alone will not be enough in many cases. We are exploring the answer to this question [here](prepare_for_interview.md)
If you have any ideas, insights, questions, ... please contribute :)

### How do I become a better DevOps Engineer?

That's even a better question than the previous one.
I don't know to answer this but what I feel works for me is to read, practice and share. One of the reasons this project was created.
I've gathered some resources, on different topics, [here](http://devopsbit.com/devops-resources)

### Why most of the questions don't have answers?

Because we need more contributors ;)<br>
Also because the maintainer really likes to ask questions and less answering them.

### Where the questions and answers are coming from?

Well, from everywhere - past experience, colleagues, contributors, ... But we do not allow copying interview questions from interview questions sites. There are people who worked hard on adding those to their sites and we respect that.

### What are top DevOps skills required for being a DevOps Engineer?

It's a hard question and the reason is that if you'll ask 20 different people, you'll probably get at least 10 different answers but here what you can check and see for yourself if going over jobs postings:

* DevOps require you good understanding of operating system concepts. The level required is mainly depends on the company
* Coding is part of DevOps. The level again depends on the company. Some will require you to know basic level of scripting while others deep understanding of common algorithms, data structure, design patterns etc.
* Cloud and Containers - while not 100% must in all companies/positions, this skill is on the rise every year and many (if not most) of the positions/companies require this skill. This specifically means: AWS/Azure/GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, ...

### I feel like there are some questions that shouldn't be included in this project

Is that a question?
In any case, if you don't like some/most of the questions or think that some questions should be removed you can open an issue or submit a PR and we can discuss it there :)

### Can I add questions and/or answers to this project?

I'll simply imagine you didn't ask that on an open source project...
