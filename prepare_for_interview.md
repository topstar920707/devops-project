## How to prepare for an DevOps interview?

Note: the following suggestions are opinionated

### Coding

Some (if not most) DevOps interviews include coding tasks/questions. Be prepared for those by doing actual coding.
Also, the following probably clear to most people but still, when given the chance to choose any language for answering questions or coding tasks, choose the one you have experience with and not the one the company is using or you think it's using.

### Prepare by answering interview questions

Make a sample list of interview questions on different topics: technical, company, role, ... and try to answer them. See if you can manage answering them in a fluent, detailed way.

### Know your resume

It may sounds strange but the idea here is simple: be ready to answer any question regarding any line you included in your resume.
Sometimes candidates surprised when they are asked on a skill or line which seems to be not related to the position but the simple truth is: if you mentioned something on your resume, it's only fair to ask you about it.

### Know the company

Be familiar with the company you are interviewing at. Some ideas:

  * What the company does
  * What products it has
  * Major achievements

### Books

From my experience this is not done by many candidates but it's one of the best ways to deep dive into topics like operating system, virtualization, scale, distributed systems, ...

### Scenarios

This is a very common way to interview today for DevOps roles. The candidate is given a task which represents a common task of DevOps Engineers or common knowledge and the candidate has several hours or days to accomplish the task.<br>

This is a great way to prepare to interviews and I recommend to try it out before actually interviewing. How? take requirements from job posts and convert them to scenarios. Let's see an example:

"Knowledge in CI/CD" -> Scenario: create a CI/CD pipeline for a project.

At this point some people ask: "but what project? I'm not working right now" and the answer is: what about GitHub? it has only 9125912851285192 projects...and a free way to set up CI to any of them.
