## How to prepare for an DevOps interview?

Note: the following suggestions are opinionated

### Coding

Some (if not most) DevOps interviews include coding tasks/questions. Be prepared for those by doing actual coding before the interview.
Also, when given the chance to choose any language, choose the one you have experience with and not the one the company is using or you think it's using.

### Prepare by answering interview questions

Make a sample list of interview questions on different topics: technical, company, role, ... and try to answer them. See if you can manage answering them in a fluent, detailed way.

### Know your resume

It may sounds strange but the idea here is simple: be ready to answer any question regarding any line you included in your resume.
Sometimes candidates surprised when they are asked on a skill or line which seems to be not related to the position but the simple truth is: if you mentioned something on your resume, it's only fair to ask you about it.

### Know the company

Be familiar with the company you are interviewing at. Some ideas:

  * What the company does
  * What products it has
  * Major achievements

### Books

From my experience this is not done by many candidates but it's one of the best ways to deep dive into topics like operating system, virtualization, scale, distributed systems, ...
