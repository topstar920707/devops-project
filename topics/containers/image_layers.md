systemctl status docker
```

### Instructions

1. Write a Dockefile. Any Dockefile! :) (just make sure it's a valid one)
2. Build an image using the Dockerfile you've wrote
3. Which of the instructions you've used, created new layers and which added image metadata?
4. What ways are there to confirm your answer to the last question?
5. Can you reduce the size of the image you've created?
