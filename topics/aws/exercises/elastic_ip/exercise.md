## AWS EC2 - Elastic IP

### Requirements

* An EC2 instance with public IP (not elastic IP)

### Objectives

1. Write down the public IP of your EC2 instance somewhere and stop & start the instance. Does the public IP address is the same? why?
2. Handle this situation so you have the same public IP even after stopping and starting the instance
