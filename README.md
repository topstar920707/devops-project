## DevOps

<a name="devops-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What is DevOps?</summary><br><b>

There are many good answers to this question.

Amazon:

"DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market."

Microsoft:

"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users. The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications."

Red Hat:

"DevOps describes approaches to speeding up the processes by which an idea (like a new software feature, a request for enhancement, or a bug fix) goes from development to deployment in a production environment where it can provide value to the user. These approaches require that development teams and operations teams communicate frequently and approach their work with empathy for their teammates. Scalability and flexible provisioning are also necessary. With DevOps, those that need power the most, get it—through self service and automation. Developers, usually coding in a standard development environment, work closely with IT operations to speed software builds, tests, and releases—without sacrificing reliability."

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the benefits of DevOps? What it can help us to achieve?</summary><br><b>

You should mention some or all of the following:

  * Collaboration
  * Improved delivery
  * Security
  * Speed
  * Scale
  * Reliability

Make sure to elaborate :)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the anti-patterns of DevOps?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Integration?</summary><br><b>

A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or a week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.

Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it's a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Deployment?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Delivery?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What CI/CD best practices are you familiar with? Or what do you consider as CI/CD best practice?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What systems and/or tools are you using for the following?:

  * CI/CD
  * Provisioning infrastructure
  * Configuration Management
  * Monitoring & alerting
  * Logging
  * Code review
  * Code coverage
  * Tests</summary><br><b>
  * CI/CD - Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis
  * Provisioning infrastructure - Terraform, CloudFormation
  * Configuration Management - Ansible, Puppet, Chef
  * Monitoring & alerting - Prometheus, Nagios
  * Logging - Logstash, Graylog, Fluentd
  * Code review - Gerrit, Review Board
  * Code coverage - Cobertura, Clover, JaCoCo
  * Tests - Robot, Serenity, Gauge
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?</summary><br><b>

In your answer you can mention one or more of the following:
  * mature vs. cutting edge
  * community size
  * architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure</summary><br><b>

In mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes are applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time
the infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples to tools which
follow mutable infrastructure paradigm.

In immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually new infrastructure. So a change
to a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology
which follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method?</summary><br><b>

  * Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user.
  * Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it's RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands
  * Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is caching? How it works? Why is it important?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain stateless vs. stateful</summary><br><b>

Stateless applications don't store any data in the host which makes it ideal for horizontal scaling and microservices.
Stateful applications depend on the storage to save state and data, typically databases are stateful applications.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe the workflow of setting up some type of web server (Apache, IIS, Tomact, ...)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "Open Source"</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe me the architecture of service/app/project/... you designed and/or implemented</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of tests are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

Styling, unit, functional, API, integration, smoke, scenario, ...

You should be able to explain those that you mention.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You need to install periodically the same package on different operating systems (Ubuntu, RHEL, ...). How would you do it?</summary><br><b>

It can be as simple as one Ansible (or other CM tool) task that runs periodically with Cron. In more advanced cases, perhaps a CI system.
</b></details>

##### SRE

<details>
<summary>Compare SRE to DevOps</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What SRE team is responsible for?</summary><br><b>

One can argue whether it's per company definition or a global one but at least according to a large companies, like Google for example, the SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their services
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an error budget?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are MTTF (mean time to failure) and MTTR (mean time to repair)? What these metrics help us to evaluate?</summary><br><b>

#### :star: Advanced

<details>
<summary>Tell me how you perform plan capacity for your CI/CD resources (e.g. servers, storage, etc.)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you structure/implement CD for an application which depends on several other applications?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you measure your CI/CD quality? Are there any metrics or KPIs you are using for measuring the quality?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a configuration drift? What problems is it causing?</summary><br><b>

Configuration drift happens when in an environment of servers with the exact same configuration and software, a certain server
or servers are being applied with updates or configuration which other servers don't get and over time these servers become
slightly different than all others.

This situation might lead to bugs which hard to identify and reproduce.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to deal with a configuration drift?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you have experience with testing cross-projects changes? (aka cross-dependency)</summary><br><b>

Note: cross-dependency is when you have two or more changes to separate projects and you would like to test them in mutual build instead of testing each change separately.

<summary>What delivery schemes are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

Unitcast: One to one communication where there is one sender and one receiver.

Broadcast: Sending a message to everyone in the network. The address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff is used for broadcasting.
           Two common protocols which use broadcast are ARP and DHCP.

Multicast: Sending a message to a group of subscribers. It can be one-to-many or many-to-many.

<summary>What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?</summary><br><b>

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred
5. They are waiting for a random time before sending again
6. Once each host waited for a random time, they try to send the frame again and so the

<summary>What is your experience with Linux?</summary><br><b>

An open question. Answer based on your real experience. You can highlight one or more of the following:

* Troubleshooting & Debugging
* Storage
* Networking
* Development
* Deployments
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what each of the following commands does and give an example on how to use it:

  * ls
  * rm 
  * rmdir (can you achieve the same result by using <code>rm</code>?)
  * grep
  * wc
  * curl
  * touch
  * man
  * nslookup or dig
  * df</summary><br><b>

  * ls - list files and directories. You can highlight common flags like -d, -a, -l, ...
  * rm - remove files and directories. You should mention -r for recursive removal
  * rmdir - remove directories but you should mention it's possible to use rm for that
  * grep - print lines that match patterns. Could be nice to mention -v, -r, -E flags
  * wc - print newline, word, and byte counts
  * curl - tranfer a URL or mention common usage like downloading files, API calls, ...
  * touch - update timestamps but common usage is to create files
  * man - reference manuals
  * nslookup or dig - query nameservers
  * df - provides info regarding file system disk space usage
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Running the command <code>df</code> you get "command not found". What could be wrong and how to fix it?</summary><br><b>
</b>
<p><b>
Most likely the default/generated $PATH was somehow modified or overridden thus not containing <code>/bin/</code> where df would normally go.
This issue could also happen if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified, causing erratics behaviours.
You would solve this by fixing your $PATH variable:

As to fix it there are serveral options:

1. Manually adding what you need to your $PATH <code>PATH="$PATH":/user/bin:/..etc</code> 
2. You have your weird env variables backed up.
3. You would look for your distro default $PATH variable, copy paste using method #1

Note: There are many ways of getting errors like this: if bash_profile or any configuration file of your interpreter was wrongly modified; causing erratics behaviours,
permissions issues, bad compiled software (if you compiled it by yourself)... there is no answer that will be true 100% of the time.</b>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you schedule tasks periodically?</summary><br><b>

You can use the commands <code>cron</code> and <code>at</code>.
With cron, tasks are scheduled using the following format:

<code>*/30 * * * * bash myscript.sh</code> Executes the script every 30 minutes.

<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week> <command to execute>

The tasks are stored in a cron file, you can write in it using <code>crontab -e</code>

Alternatively if you are using a distro with systemd it's recommended to use systemd timers.

<summary>What is systemd?</summary><br>
<b>
Systemd is a daemon (System 'd', d stands from daemon).

A daemon is a program that runs in the background without direct control of the user, although the user can at any time
talk to the daemon.

systemd has many features such as user processes control/tracking, snapshot support, inhibitor locks..


If we visualize the unix/linux system in layers, systemd would fall directly after the linux kernel.

Hardware -> Kernel -> <u>Daemons</u>, System Libraries, Server Display.

<summary>How can you find how much memory a specific process consumes?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What signal is used by default when you run 'kill <process id>'?</summary><br><b>
<pre>
The default signal is SIGTERM (15). This signal kills
process gracefully which means it allows it to save current
state configuration.
</pre>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What signals are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

SIGTERM - default signal for terminating a process
SIGHUP - common usage is for reloading configuration

Running (R)
Uninterruptible Sleep (D) - The process is waiting for I/O
Interruptible Sleep (S)

Dead (x)
Zombie (z)
</pre>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a zombie process?</summary><br><b>

A process which has finished to run but has not exited.

One reason it happens is when a parent process is programmed incorrectly. Every parent process should execute wait() to get the exit code from the child process which finished to run. But when the parent isn't checking for the child exit code, the child process can still exists although it finished to run.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to get rid of zombie processes?</summary><br><b>

You can't kill a zombie process the regular way with `kill -9` for example as it's already dead.

One way to kill zombie process is by sending SIGCHLD to the parent process telling it to terminate its child processes. This might not work if the parent process wasn't programmed properly. The invocation is `kill -s SIGCHLD [parent_pid]`

You can also try closing/terminating the parent process. This will make the zombie process a child of init (1) which does periodic cleanups and will at some point clean up the zombie process.

## Operating System

<a name="operating-system-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What is an operating system?</summary><br><b>

There are many ways to answer that. For those who look for simplicity, the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" offers nice version:

"responsible for making it easy to run programs (even allowing you to seemingly run many at the same time), allowing programs to share memory, enabling programs to interact with devices, and other fun stuff like that"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you had to design an API for processes in an operating system, what would this API look like?</summary><br><b>

* Create - allow to create new processes 
* Delete - allow to remove/destroy processes
* State - allow to check the state of the process, whether it's running, stopped, waiting, etc.
* Stop - allow to stop a running process
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How a process is created?</summary><br><b>

* The OS is reading program's code and any additional relevant data
* Program's bytes are loaded into the memory or more specifically, into the address space of the process.
* Memory is allocated for program's stack (aka run-time stack). The stack also initialized by the OS with data like argv, argc and parameters to main()
* Memory is allocated for program's heap which is required for data structures like linked lists and hash tables
* I/O initialization tasks like in Unix/Linux based systems where each process has 3 file descriptors (input, output and error)
* OS is running the program, strarting from main()

Note: The loading of the program's code into the memory done lazily which means the OS loads only partial relevant pieces required for the process to run and not the entire code.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? The loading of the program into the memory is done eagerly (all at once)</summary><br><b>

False. It was true in the past but today's operating systems perform lazy loading which means only the relevant pieces required for the process to run are loaded first.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are different states of a process?</summary><br><b>

* Running - it's executing instructions
* Ready - it's ready to run but for different reasons it's on hold
* Blocked - it's waiting for some operation to complete. For example I/O disk request

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "time sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Even when using a system with one physical CPU, it's possible to allow multiple users to work on it and run programs. This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is "space sharing"?</summary><br><b>

Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way it's not being transfered between them.<br>
It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is your until you decide to delete it.
</b></details>

## Ansible

<a name="ansible-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>Describe each of the following components in Ansible, including the relationship between them:

  * Task
  * Module
  * Play
  * Playbook
  * Role</summary><br><b>

Task – a call to a specific Ansible module
Module – the actual unit of code executed by Ansible on your own host or a remote host. Modules are indexed by category (database, file, network, …) and also referred as task plugins.

Play – One or more tasks executed on a given host(s)

Playbook – One or more plays. Each play can be executed on the same or different hosts

Role – Ansible roles allows you to group resources based on certain functionality/service such that they can be easily reused. In a role, you have directories for variables, defaults, files, templates, handlers, tasks, and metadata. You can then use the role by simply specifying it in your playbook.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which Ansible best practices are you familiar with?. Name at least three</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an inventory file and how you define one?</summary><br><b>

An inventory file defines hosts and/or groups of hosts on which Ansible tasks executed upon.

An example of inventory file:

192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4

[web_servers]
190.40.2.20
190.40.2.21
190.40.2.22
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a dynamic inventory file? When you would use one?</summary><br><br>

A dynamic inventory file tracks hosts from one or more sources like cloud providers and CMDB systems.

You should use one when using external sources and especially when the hosts in your environment are being automatically<br>
spun up and shut down, without you tracking every change in these sources.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You want to run Ansible playbook only on specific minor version of your OS, how would you achieve that?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Write a task to create the directory ‘/tmp/new_directory’</summary><br><b>

```

  file:

      state: directory
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What would be the result of the following play?</summary><br><b>

```
---
- name: Print information about my host
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: 'no'                                                                                                                                                                           
  tasks:
      - name: Print hostname
        debug:
            msg: "It's me, {{ ansible_hostname }}"
```

When given a written code, always inspect it thoroughly. If your answer is “this will fail” then you are right. We are using a fact (ansible_hostname), which is a gathered piece of information from the host we are running on. But in this case, we disabled facts gathering (gather_facts: no) so the variable would be undefined which will result in failure.

<summary>The variable 'whoami' defined in the following places:

  * role defaults -> whoami: mario
  * extra vars (variables you pass to Ansible CLI with -e) -> whoami: toad
  * host facts -> whoami: luigi
  * inventory variables (doesn’t matter which type) -> whoami: browser

According to variable precedence, which one will be used?</summary><br><b>

The right answer is ‘toad’.

Variable precedence is about how variables override each other when they set in different locations. If you didn’t experience it so far I’m sure at some point you will, which makes it a useful topic to be aware of.

In the context of our question, the order will be extra vars (always override any other variable) -> host facts -> inventory variables -> role defaults (the weakest).

A full list can be found at the link above. Also, note there is a significant difference between Ansible 1.x and 2.x.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>For each of the following statements determine if it's true or false:

  * A module is a collection of tasks
  * It’s better to use shell or command instead of a specific module
  * Host facts override play variables
  * A role might include the following: vars, meta, and handlers
  * Dynamic inventory is generated by extracting information from external sources
  * It’s a best practice to use indention of 2 spaces instead of 4
  * ‘notify’ used to trigger handlers
  * This “hosts: all:!controllers” means ‘run only on controllers group hosts</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is Terraform? How it works?</summary><br><b>

Read [here](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html#what-is-terraform-)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What benefits infrastructure-as-code has?</summary><br><b>

- fully automated process of provisioning, modifying and deleting your infrastructure
- version control for your infrastructure which allows you to quickly rollback to previous versions
- validate infrastructure quality and stability with automated tests and code reviews
- makes infrastructure tasks less repetitive
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why Terraform and not other technologies? (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, CloufFormation)</summary><br><b>

A common *wrong* answer is to say that Ansible and Puppet are configuration management tools
and Terraform is a provisioning tool. While technically true, it doesn't mean Ansible and Puppet can't
be used for provisioning infrastructure. Also, it doesn't explain why Terraform should be used over
CloudFormation if at all.

The benefits of Terraform over the other tools:

  * It follows the immutable infrastructure approach which has benefits like avoiding a configuration drift over time
  * Ansible and Puppet are more procedural (you mention what to execute in each step) and Terraform is declarative since you describe the overall desired state and not per resource or task. You can give the example of going from 1 to 2 servers in each tool. In Terraform you specify 2, in Ansible and puppet you have to only provision 1 additional server so you need to explicitly make sure you provision only another one server.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is "Terraform configuration"</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain each of the following:

  * Provider
  * Resource 
  * Provisioner 
</summary><br><b>
  * Provider is any cloud based technology - github, aws, postgresql etc - which one can make an API call to with its unique terraform provider binary to provision available services and components.<br>  
  * Resources are the services and components you provision on these platforms.<br>
  * Provisioner in terraform's lingo specifically refers to configuration tools like ansible or salt-stack which are used in combination with terraform to orchestrate a system.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What <code>terraform.tfstate</code> file is used for?</summary><br><b> 

It keeps track of the IDs of created resources so that Terraform knows what it is managing.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what the following commands do:

  * <code>terraform init</code> 
  * <code>terraform plan</code>	
  * <code>terraform validate</code> 
  * <code>terraform apply</code> 
</summary><br><b>

<code>terraform init</code> scans your code to figure which providers are you using and download them.
<code>terraform plan</code> will let you see what terraform is about to do before actually doing it.
<code>terraform apply</code> will provision the resources specified in the .tf files.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to write down a variable which changes by an external source or during <code>terraform apply</code>?</summary><br><b>

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain "State Locking"</summary><br><b>
  State locking is a mechanism that blocks an operations against a specific state file from multiple callers so as to avoid conflicting   operations from different team members. Once the first caller's operation's lock is released the other team member may go ahead to   
  carryout his own operation. Nevertheless Terraform will first check the state file to see if the desired resource already exist and 
  if not it goes ahead to create it.

<details>
<summary>How containers are different from VMs?</summary><br><b>

The primary difference between containers and VMs is that containers allow you to virtualize
multiple workloads on the operating system while in the case of VMs the hardware is being virtualized to
run multiple machines each with its own OS.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In which scenarios would you use containers and in which you would prefer to use VMs?</summary><br><b>

You should choose VMs when:
  * you need run an application which requires all the resources and functionalities of an OS
  * you need full isolation and security

You should choose containers when:
  * you need a lightweight solution
  * Running multiple versions or instances of a single application

Docker daemon downloads the image from Docker Hub
Docker daemon creates a new container by using the image it downloaded
Docker daemon redirects output from container to Docker CLI which redirects it to the standard output

<summary>You suspect one of the pods is having issues, what do you do?</summary><br><b>

Start by inspecting the pods status. we can use the command `kubectl get pods` (--all-namespaces for pods in system namespace)<br>

If we see "Error" status, we can keep debugging by running the command `kubectl describe pod [name]`. In case we still don't see anything useful we can try stern for log tailing.<br>

In case we find out there was a temporary issue with the pod or the system, we can try restarting the pod with the following `kubectl scale deployment [name] --replicas=0`<br>

Setting the replicas to 0 will shut down the process. Now start it with `kubectl scale deployment [name] --replicas=1`

It's a search algorithm used with sorted arrays/lists to find a target value by dividing the array each iteration and comparing the middle value to the target value. If the middle value is smaller than target value, then the target value is searched in the right part of the divided array, else in the left side. This continues until the value is found (or the array divided max times)

<summary>What are some characteristics of the Python programming language?</summary><br><b>

```
1. It is a high level general purpose programming language created in 1991 by Guido Van Rosum.
2. The language is interpreted, being the CPython (Written in C) the most used/maintained implementation.
3. It is strongly typed. The typing discipline is duck typing and gradual.
4. Python focuses on readability and makes use of whitespaces/identation instead of brackets { }
5. The python package manager is called PIP "pip installs packages", having more than 200.000 available packages.
6. Python comes with pip installed and a big standard library that offers the programmer many precooked solutions.
7. In python **Everything** is an object.

There are many other characteristics but these are the main ones that every python programmer should know.

<summary>What data types supported in Python and which of them are mutable? How can you show that a certain data type is mutable?</summary><br><b>

The mutable data types are:

    List
    Dictionary
    Set
    
The immutable data types are:

    Numbers (int, float, ...)
    String
    Bool
    Tuple
    Frozenset

You can usually use the function hash() to check an object mutability, if it is hashable it is immutable, although this does not always work as intended as user defined objects might be mutable and hashable

    2. Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
    3. Use commas when making a tuple of one element
    4. Use spaces (and not tabs) for indentation
    5. Use 4 spaces per indentation level

<summary>Explain inheritance and how to use it in Python</summary><br><b>

```
By definition inheritance is the mechanism where an object acts as a base of another object, retaining all its
properties.

So if Class B inherits from Class A, every characteristics from class A will be also available in class B.
Class A would be the 'Base class' and B class would be the 'derived class'.

This comes handy when you have several classes that share the same functionalities.

The basic syntax is:

class Base: pass

class Derived(Base): pass

A more forged example:

class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        print("and I'm alive!")

    def eat(self, food):
        print("ñom ñom ñom", food)

class Human(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is ', name)
        super().__init__()

    def write_poem(self):
        print('Foo bar bar foo foo bar!')

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print('My name is', name)
        super().__init__()

    def bark(self):
        print('woof woof')


michael = Human('Michael')
michael.eat('Spam')
michael.write_poem()

bruno = Dog('Bruno')
bruno.eat('bone')
bruno.bark()

>>> My name is  Michael
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom Spam
>>> Foo bar bar foo foo bar!
>>> My name is Bruno
>>> and I'm alive!
>>> ñom ñom ñom bone
>>> woof woof

Calling super() calls the Base method, thus, calling super().__init__() we called the Animal __init__.

There is a more advanced python feature called MetaClasses that aid the programmer to directly control class creation.

<summary> What is an error? What is an exception? What types of exceptions are you familiar with?</summary><br><b>

```

#  Note that you generally don't need to know the compiling process but knowing where everything comes from
#  and giving complete answers shows that you truly know what you are talking about.

Generally, every compiling process have a two steps.
    - Analysis
    - Code Generation.
    
    Analysis can be broken into:
        1. Lexical analysis   (Tokenizes source code)
        2. Syntactic analysis (Check whether the tokens are legal or not, tldr, if syntax is correct)
           
               for i in 'foo'
                          ^
             SyntaxError: invalid syntax
        
        We missed ':'
        
        
        3. Semantic analysis  (Contextual analysis, legal syntax can still trigger errors, did you try to divide by 0,
          hash a mutable object or use an undeclared function?)
          
                 1/0
                ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
        
    These three analysis steps are the responsible for error handlings.
    
    The second step would be responsible for errors, mostly syntax errors, the most common error.
    The third step would be responsible for Exceptions.
    
    As we have seen, Exceptions are semantic errors, there are many builtin Exceptions:
        
        ImportError
        ValueError
        KeyError
        FileNotFoundError
        IndentationError
        IndexError
        ...
    
    You can also have user defined Exceptions that have to inherit from the `Exception` class, directly or indirectly.

    Basic example:
        
    class DividedBy2Error(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message):
            self.message = message
    
    
    def division(dividend,divisor):
        if divisor == 2:
            raise DividedBy2Error('I dont want you to divide by 2!')
        return dividend / divisor
    
    division(100, 2)
    
    >>> __main__.DividedBy2Error: I dont want you to divide by 2!

<summary>How to check if all the elements in a given lists are unique? so [1, 2, 3] is unique but [1, 1, 2, 3] is not unique because 1 exists twice</summary><br><b>
</b>

There are many ways of solving this problem:<br>
<code># Note: :list and -> bool are just python typings, they are not needed for the correct execution of the algorithm. </code>

Taking advantage of sets and len:

```
def is_unique(l:list) -> bool:
    return len(set(l)) == len(l)
```

This one is can be seen used in other programming languages.

```
def is_unique2(l:list) -> bool:
    seen = []

    for i in l:
        if i in seen:
            return False
        seen.append(i)
    return True
```

Here we just count and make sure every element is just repeated once.

```
def is_unique3(l:list) -> bool:
    for i in l:
        if l.count(i) > 1:
            return False
    return True
```

This one might look more convulated but hey, one liners.

```
def is_unique4(l:list) -> bool:
    return all(map(lambda x: l.count(x) < 2, l))
```

<summary>What empty <code>return</code> returns?</summary><br><b>
</b>

Short answer is: It returns a None object.

We could go a bit deeper and explain the difference between 

```
def a ():
    return
    
>>> None
```

And

```
def a ():
    pass
    
>>> None
```
Or we could be asked this as a following question, since they both give the same result.

We could use the dis module to see what's going on:

```
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (<code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('a')
              4 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
              6 STORE_NAME               0 (a)

  5           8 LOAD_CONST               2 (<code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>)
             10 LOAD_CONST               3 ('b')
             12 MAKE_FUNCTION            0
             14 STORE_NAME               1 (b)
             16 LOAD_CONST               4 (None)
             18 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object a at 0x0000029C4D3C2DB0, file "<dis>", line 2>:
  3           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE

Disassembly of <code object b at 0x0000029C4D3C2ED0, file "<dis>", line 5>:
  6           0 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
              2 RETURN_VALUE
```

An empty <code> return</code> is exactly the same as <code>return None</code> and functions without any explicit return
will always return None regardless of the operations, therefore 


```
def sum(a, b):
    global c
    c = a + b
    
>>> None
```

<summary>Explain what is a decorator</summary><br><b>
</b>
<b>In python, everything is an object, even functions themselves. Therefore you could pass functions as arguments
for another function eg;

```
def wee(word):
    return word

def oh(f):
    return f + "Ohh"
    
>>> oh(wee("Wee"))
<<< Wee Ohh
```

This allows us to control the before execution of any given function and if we added another function as wrapper,
(a function receiving another function that receives a function as parameter) we could also control the after execution.

Sometimes we want to control the before-after execution of many functions and it would get tedious to write

<code> f = function(function_1())</code>
<code> f = function(function_1(function_2(*args)))</code>

every time, that's what decorators do, they introduce syntax to write all of this on the go, using the keyword '@'.
</b>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can you show how to write and use decorators?</summary><br><b>

<code>
These two decorators (ntimes and timer) are usually used to display decorators functionalities, you can find them in lots of
tutorials/reviews. I first saw these examples two years ago in pyData 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lmCu8wz8ro&t=3731s</code>

```
Simple decorator:

def deco(f):
    print(f"Hi I am the {f.__name__}() function!")
    return f

@deco
def hello_world():
    return "Hi, I'm in!"

a = hello_world()
print(a)

>>> Hi I am the hello_world() function!
    Hi, I'm in!
```

This is the simplest decorator version, it basically saves us from writting <code>a = deco(hello_world())</code>.
But at this point we can only control the before execution, let's take on the after:

```
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Rick Sanchez!")
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        print("I'm in!")
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f(word):
    print(word)

a = f("************")
>>> Rick Sanchez!
    ************
    I'm in!
```

deco receives a function -> f
wrapper receives the arguments -> *args, **kwargs

wrapper returns the function plus the arguments -> f(*args, **kwargs)
deco returns wrapper.

As you can see we conveniently do things before and after the execution of a given function.

For example, we could write a decorator that calculates the execution time of a function.

```
import time
def deco(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        before = time.time()
        func = f(*args, **kwargs)
        after = time.time()
        print(after-before)
        return func
    return wrapper

@deco
def f():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("************")

a = f()
>>> 2.0008859634399414
```

Or create a decorator that executes a function n times.

```
def n_times(n):
    def wrapper(f):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func = f(*args, **kwargs)
            return func
        return inner
    return wrapper

@n_times(4)
def f():
    print("************")

a = f()

>>>************
   ************
   ************
   ************

<summary>What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>?</summary><br><b>

Shortly, git pull = git fetch + git merge

When you run git pull, it gets all the changes from the remote or central
repository and attaches it to your corresponding branch in your local repository.

git fetch gets all the changes from the remote repository, stores the changes in
a separate branch in your local repository

<summary>Explain the following: <code>git directory</code>, <code>working directory</code> and <code>staging area</code></summary><br><b>

The Git directory is where Git stores the meta data and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.

<details>
<summary>How to resolve git merge conflicts?</summary><br><b>

<p>
First, you open the files which are in conflict and identify what are the conflicts.
Next, based on what is accepted in your company or team, you either discuss with your
colleagues on the conflicts or resolve them by yourself
After resolving the conflicts, you add the files with `git add <file_name>`
Finally, you run `git rebase --continue`
</p>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>git reset</code> and <code>git revert</code>?</summary><br><b>

<p>

`git revert` creates a new commit which undoes the changes from last commit.

`git reset` depends on the usage, can modify the index or change the commit which the branch head
is currently pointing at.

  * Strong and static typing - the type of the variables can't be changed over time and they have to be defined at compile time
  * Simplicity 
  * Fast compile times
  * Built-in concurrency

  * Compile to standalone binary - anything you need to run your app will be compiled into one binary. Very useful for version management in run-time. 

Go also has good community.

<summary>What is the difference between <code>var x int = 2</code> and <code>x := 2</code>?</summary><br><b>

The result is the same, a variable with the value 2.

It looks what unicode value is set at 101 and uses it for converting the integer to a string.

  * Comments on how to run it and/or what it does
  * Adding "set -e" since I want the script to exit if a certain command failed

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False?: when a certain command/line fails, the script, by default, will exit and will no keep running</summary><br><b>

Depends on the language and settings used.
When a script written in Bash fails to run a certain command it will keep running and will execute all other commands mentioned after the command which failed.
Most of the time we would actually want the opposite to happen. In order to make Bash exist when a specific command fails, use 'set -e' in your script.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Today we have tools and technologies like Ansible. Why would someone still use shell scripting?</summary><br><b>

  * Speed
  * The module we need doesn't exist
  * We are delivering the scripts to customers who don't have access to the public network and don't necessarily have Ansible installed on their systems.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you debug shell scripts?</summary><br><b>

Answer depends on the language you are using for writing your scripts. If Bash is used for example then:

  * Adding -x to the script I'm running in Bash
  * Old good way of adding echo statements

If Python, then using pdb is very useful.

## SQL

<a name="sql-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What does SQL stand for?</summary><br><b>

Structured Query Language

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How is SQL Different from NoSQL</summary><br><b>

The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of
tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is 
unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such
as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?</summary><br>

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. In order to be ACID compliant, the database much meet each of the four criteria

**Atomicity** - When a change occurs to the database, it should either succeed or fail as a whole. 

For example, if you were to update a table, the update should completely execute. If it only partially executes, the 
update is considered failed as a whole, and will not go through - the DB will revert back to it's original
state before the update occurred. It should also be mentioned that Atomicity ensures that each 
transaction is completed as it's own stand alone "unit" - if any part fails, the whole statement fails.

**Consistency** - any change made to the database should bring it from one valid state into the next.

For example, if you make a change to the DB, it shouldn't corrupt it. Consistency is upheld by checks and constraints that
are pre-defined in the DB. For example, if you tried to change a value from a string to an int when the column
should be of datatype string, a consistent DB would not allow this transaction to go through, and the action would
not be executed

**Isolation** - this ensures that a database will never be seen "mid-update" - as multiple transactions are running at
the same time, it should still leave the DB in the same state as if the transactions were being run sequentially.

For example, let's say that 20 other people were making changes to the database at the same time. At the
time you executed your query, 15 of the 20 changes had gone through, but 5 were still in progress. You should
only see the 15 changes that had completed - you wouldn't see the database mid-update as the change goes through.

**Durability** - Once a change is committed, it will remain committed regardless of what happens
(power failure, system crash, etc.). This means that all completed transactions 
must be recorded in non-volatile memory. 

Note that SQL is by nature ACID compliant. Certain NoSQL DB's can be ACID compliant depending on 
how they operate, but as a general rule of thumb, NoSQL DB's are not considered ACID compliant
</details>

<details>
<summary>When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?</summary><br><b>

SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many
businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.

NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications 
in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to 
multiple servers

Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure
that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Cartesian Product?</summary><br>

A Cartesian product is when all rows from the first table are joined to all rows in the second
table. This can be done implicitly by not defining a key to join, or explicitly by 
calling a CROSS JOIN on two tables, such as below:

Select * from customers **CROSS JOIN** orders;

Note that a Cartesian product can also be a bad thing - when performing a join
on two tables in which both do not have unique keys, this could cause the returned information
to be incorrect. 
</details>

##### SQL Specific Questions

For these questions, we will be using the Customers and Orders tables shown below:

**Customers**

Customer_ID | Customer_Name | Items_in_cart | Cash_spent_to_Date
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100204 | John Smith | 0 | 20.00
100205 | Jane Smith | 3 | 40.00
100206 | Bobby Frank | 1 | 100.20

**ORDERS**

Customer_ID | Order_ID | Item | Price | Date_sold
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
100206 | A123 | Rubber Ducky | 2.20 | 2019-09-18
100206 | A123 | Bubble Bath | 8.00 | 2019-09-18
100206 | Q987 | 80-Pack TP | 90.00 | 2019-09-20
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Tuna Fish | 10.00 | 2019-08-05

100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Beef | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100205 | Z001 | Cat Food - Kitty quesadilla | 10.00 | 2019-08-05
100204 | X202 | Coffee | 20.00 | 2019-04-29

<summary>How many people have items in their cart?</summary><br><b>

Select count(1) as Number_of_People_w_items <br>
From Customers <br>
where Items_in_cart > 0;
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you join the customer table to the order table?</summary><br><b>

You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in
both the Customers table and Orders table
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you show which customer ordered which items?</summary><br><b>

Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br>
From Customers c <br>
Left Join Orders o <br>
  On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;

</b></details>

<a name="sql-advanced"></a>
#### Advanced

<details>
<summary>Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?</summary><br><b>

with cat_food as ( <br>
Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Orders <br>
Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br>
Group by Customer_ID <br>
) <br>
Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br>
From Customers c <br>
Inner JOIN cat_food f <br>
  ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br>
where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);

Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when 
a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice, 
because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.

The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create
the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally.

## Elastic

<a name="elastic-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What is the Elastic Stack?</summary><br><b>

The Elastic Stack consists of:

  * Elasticsearch
  * Elastic Hadoop
  * Kibana
  * Logstash
  * Beats
  * APM Server

The most used projects are the Elasticserach, Logstash and Kibana. Also known as the ELK stack.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe what happens from the moment the app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in the dashboard when the Elastic stack is used</summary><br><b>  

1. The data logged by the application is sent to Elasticsearch
2. Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access
3. Logstash processes the data
4. The user creates visualizations which uses the index in elasticsearch and more specifically the data there (this is done in Kibana).
5. The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created earlier
</b></details>

##### Elasticsearch

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Elasticsearch</summary><br><b>

From the official [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/documents-indices.html):

"Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Index?</summary><br><b>

Index in Elastic is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br>
You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).

The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):

"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data"
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an Inverted Index?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a Document?</summary><br><b>

Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elastic is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL.
As in NoSQL a Document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability</summary><br><b>

False.

From the official docs:

"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What reserved fields a document has?</summary><br><b>

  * _index
  * _id
  * _type
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Mapping</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)</summary><br><b>

* You can optimize fields for partial matching
* You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)
* You can perform language-specific analysis
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Shards</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Replicas</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

##### Query DSL

<details>
<summary>Explain Elasticsearch query syntax (Booleans, Fields, Ranges)</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what is Relevance Score</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain Query Context and Filter Context</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"In the query context, a query clause answers the question “How well does this document match this query clause?” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the _score meta-field."

"In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “Does this document match this query clause?” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data"
</b></details>

##### Logstash

<details>
<summary>What are Logstash plugins? What plugins types are there?</summary><br><b>

  * Input Plugins - how to collect data from different sources
  * Filter Plugins - processing data
  * Output Plugins - push data to different outputs/services/platforms
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are Logstash Codecs?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

##### Kibana

<details>
<summary>What is Kibana?</summary><br><b>

From the official docs:

"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps."
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What visualization types are supported/included in Kibana?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What visualization type would you use for statistical outliers</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe in detail how do you create a dashboard in Kibana</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

##### Beats

<details>
<summary>What is Filebeat?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<a name="elastic-advanced"></a>
#### :star: Advnaced

<details>
<summary>Describe how would an architecture of production environment with large amounts of data would be different from a small-scale environment</summary><br><b>

There are several possible answers for this question. One of them is as follows:

A small-scale architecture of elastic will consist of the elastic stack as it is. This means we will have beats, logstash, elastcsearch and kibana.<br>
A production environment with large amounts of data can include some kind of buffering component (e.g. Reddis or RabbitMQ) and also security component such as Nginx.
</b></details>

## DNS

<a name="dns-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>What is DNS? What is it used for?</summary><br><b>

DNS (Domain Name Systems) is a protocol used for converting domain names into IP addresses.<br>
As you know computer networking is done with IP addresses (layer 3 of the OSI model) but for as humans it's hard to remember IP addresses, it's much easier to remember names. This why we need something such as DNS to convert any domain name we type into an IP address. You can think on DNS as a huge phonebook or database where each corresponding name has an IP.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How DNS works?</summary><br><b>

In general the process is as follows:

  * The user types an address in the web browser (some_site.com)
  * The operating system gets a request from the browser to translate the address the user entered
  * A query created to check a local entry of the address exists in the system. In case it doesn't, the request is forwarded to the DNS resolver
  * The Resolver is a server, usually configured by your ISP when you connect to the internet, that responsible for resolving your query by contacting other DNS servers
  * The Resolver contacts the root nameserver (aka as .)
  * The root nameserver responds with the address of the relevant Top Level Domain DNS server (if your address ends with org then the org TLD)
  * The Resolver then contacts the TLD DNS and TLD DNS responds with the IP address that matches the address the user typed in the browser
  * The Resolver passes this information to the browser
  * The user is happy :D
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What types of DNS records are there?</summary><br><b>

  * A
  * PTR
  * MX
  * AAAA
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a A record?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a AAAA record?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a PTR record?</summary><br><b>

While an A record points a domain name to an IP address, a PTR record does the opposite and resolves the IP address to a domain name.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a MX record?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Is DNS using TCP or UDP?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is Round Robin DNS?</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>What is DNS Record TTL? Why do we need it?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a zone? What types of zones are there?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

## Distributed

<details>
<summary>Explain Distributed Computing</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Do you know what is CAP theorem" (aka as Brewer's theorem)</summary><br><b>

According to the CAP theorem, it's not possible for a distributed data store to provide more than two of the following at the same time:

* Availability: Every request receives a response (it doesn't has to be the most recent data)
* Consistency: Every request receives a response with the latest/most recent data
* Partition tolerance: Even if some the data is lost/dropped, the system keeps running 
</b></details>

## General

<details>
<summary>What is HTTP?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Describe HTTP request lifecycle</summary><br><b>

* Resolve host by request to DNS resolver
* Client SYN
* Server SYN+ACK
* Client SYN
* HTTP request
* HTTP response
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>True or False? HTTP is stateful</summary><br><b>

False. Server doesn't maintain state for incoming request.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How HTTP request looks like?</summary><br><b>

It consits of:

 * Request line - request type
 * Headers - content info like length, enconding, etc.
 * Body (not always included)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What HTTP method types are there?</summary><br><b>

* GET
* POST
* HEAD
* PUT
* DELETE
* CONNECT
* OPTIONS
* TRACE
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What HTTP response codes are there?</summary><br><b>

* 1xx - informational
* 2xx - Success
* 3xx - Redirect
* 4xx - Error, client fault
* 5xx - Error, server fault
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is HTTPS?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain HTTP Cookies</summary><br><b>

HTTP is stateless. To share state, we can use Cookies.

TODO: explain what is actually a Cookie

## HR

Although the following questions are not DevOps related, they are still quite common and part of the DevOps interview process so it's better to prepare for them as well.

<details>
<summary>Tell us little bit about yourself</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Tell me about your last big project/task you worked on</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was most challenging part in the project you worked on?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why do you want to work here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How did you hear about us?</summary><br><b>

Tell them how did you hear about them :D
Relax, there is no wrong or right answer here...I think.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How would you describe a good leadership? What makes a good boss for you?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Tell me about a time where you didn't agree on an implementation</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How do you deal with a situation where key stakeholders are not around and a big decision needs to be made? </summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Give an example of a time you were able to change the view of a team about a particular tool/project/technology</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever caused a service outage? (or broke a working project, tool, ...?)</summary><br><b>

If you worked in this area for more than 5 areas it's hard to imagine the answer would be no. It also doesn't have to be big service outage. Maybe you merged some code that broke a project or its tests. Simply focus on what you learned from such experience.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Rank the following in order 1 to 5, where 1 is most important: salaray, benefits, career, team/people, work life balance</summary><br><b>

You know best your order just have a good thought if you really want to put salary in top or bottom....
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have three important tasks scheduled for today. One is for your boss, second for a colleague who is also a friend, third is for a customer. All tasks are equally important. What do you do first?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have a colleague you don‘t get along with. Tell us some strategies how you create a good work relationship with them anyway.</summary><br><b>

Bad answer: I don't.
Better answer: Every person has strengths and weaknesses. This is true also for colleagues I don't have good work relationship with and this is what helps me to create good work relationship with them. If I am able to highlight or recognize their strengths I'm able to focus mainly on that when communicating with them.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What do you love about your work?</summary><br><b>

You know the best, but some ideas if you find it hard to express yourself:

* Diversity
* Complexity
* Challenging
* Communication with several different teams
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are your responsibilities in your current position?</summary><br><b>

You know the best :)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why should we hire you for the role?</summary><br><b>

You can use and elaborate on one or all of the following:

* Passion
* Motivation 
* Autodidact
* Creativity (be able to support it with some actual examples)
</b></details>

## Questions you CAN ask

A list of questions you as a candidate can ask the interviewer during or after the interview.
These are only a suggestion, use them carefully. Not every interviewer will be able to answer these (or happy to) which should be perhaps a red flag warning for your regarding working in such place but that's really up to you.

<details>
<summary>What do you like about working here?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How does the company promote personal growth?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the current level of technical debt you are dealing with?</summary><br><b>

Be careful when asking this question - all companies, regardless of size, have some level of tech debt. 
Phrase the question in the light that all companies have the deal with this, but you want to see the current
pain points they are dealing with <br>

This is a great way to figure how managers deal with unplanned work, and how good they are at 
setting expectations with projects.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What was your favorite project you've worked on?</summary><br><b>

This can give you insights in some of the cool projects a company is working on, and if 
you would enjoy working on projects like these. This is also a good way to see if
the managers are allowing employees to learn and grow with projects outside of the
normal work you'd do.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If you could change one thing about your day to day, what would it be?</summary><br><b>

Similar to the tech debt question, this helps you identify any pain points with the company.
Additionally, it can be a great way to show how you'd be an asset to the team.<br>

For Example, if they mention they have problem X, and you've solved that in the past,
you can show how you'd be able to mitigate that problem.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Let's say that we agree and you hire me to this position, after X months, what do you expect that I have achieved?</summary><br><b>

Not only this will tell you what is expected from you, it will also provide big hint on the type of work you are going to do in the first months of your job.
</b></details>

## Scenarios

Scenarios are questions which don't have verbal answer and require you one of the following:

  * Set up environments
  * Write scripts
  * Design and/or develop infrastructure projects

These questions usually given as an home task to the candidate and they can combine several topics together.
Below you can find several scenario questions:

* [Writing a Dockerfile and running a container](scenarios/write_dockerfile_run_container.md)
* [Elasticsearch & Kibana on AWS](scenarios/elk_kibana_aws.md)
* [Ansible, Minikube and Docker](scenarios/ansible_minikube_docker.md)
* [Cloud Slack bot](scenarios/cloud_slack_bot.md)
* [Jenkins: writing scripts](scenarios/jenkins_scripts.md)
* [Jenkins: writing pipelines](scenarios/jenkins_pipelines.md)
* [CI for open source project](scenarios/ci_for_open_source_project.md)
