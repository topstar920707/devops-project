# DevOps Interview Questions


:information_source: &nbsp;This repository contains interview questions on various DevOps related topics

:bar_chart: &nbsp;There are currently **257** questions

:warning: &nbsp;You don't need to know how to answer all the questions in this repo. DevOps is not about knowing all :)

:exclamation: &nbsp;Some questions are more for testing your own knowledge than actual valid interview questions

:exclamation: &nbsp;For interviewers, I suggest focusing on 3 things: the resume of the candidate, scenario questions and technical concepts. Don't have an interview of only specific technical questions

:pencil: &nbsp;You can add more questions & answers by submitting pull requests :)

<details>
<summary>What is Continuous Integration?</summary><br><b>

A development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently. It can range from a couple of changes every day or week to a couple of changes in one hour in larger scales.

Each piece of code (change/patch) is verified, to make the change is safe to merge. Today, it's a common practice to test the change using an automated build that makes sure the code can integrated. It can be one build which runs several tests in different levels (unit, functional, etc.) or several separate builds that all or some has to pass in order for the change to be merged into the repository.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What are you taking into consideration when choosing a tool/technology?</summary><br><b>

You may use one or all of the following:
  * mature vs. cutting edge
  * community size
  * architecture aspects - agent vs. agentless, master vs. masterless, etc.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What the difference between VPN and VPS?</summary><br><b>

<details>
<summary>How long do you think it would take you to learn another language?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain mutable vs. immutable infrastructure</summary><br><b>

In mutable infrastructure paradigm, changes applied on top of the existing infrastructure and over time
the infrastructure builds up a history of changes. Ansible, Puppet and Chef are examples to tools which
follow mutable infrastructure paradigm.

In immutable infrastructure paradigm, every change is actually new infrastructure. So a change
to a server will result in a new server instead of updating it. Terraform is an example of technology
which follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What ways are you familiar with to deliver a software?</summary><br><b>

  * Archive - collect all your app files into one archive (e.g. tar) and deliver it to the user.
  * Package - depends on the OS, you can use your OS package format (e.g. in RHEL/Fefodra it's RPM) to deliver your software with a way to install, uninstall and update it using the standard packager commands
  * Images - Either VM or container images where your package is included with everything it needs in order to run successfully.

<summary>What is a configuration drift? What problems is it causing?</summary><br><b>

Configuration drift happens when in an environment of servers with the exact same configuration and software, a certain server
or servers are being applied with updates or configuration which other servers don't get and over time these servers become
slightly different than all others.

This situation might lead to bugs which hard to identify and reproduce.

<summary>What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?</summary><br><b>

CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection.
Its primarily focus it to manage access to shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point of time.

CSMA/CD algorithm:

1. Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host already transmitting a frame.
2. If no one transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.
3. If two hosts transmitted at the same time, we have a collision.
4. Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send to everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occured
5. They are waiting for a random time before sending again
6. Once each host waited for a raondom time, they try to send the frame again and so the

## Ansible

<a name="ansible-beginner"></a>
#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>Describe each of the following components in Ansible, including the relationship between them:

  * Task
  * Module
  * Play
  * Playbook
  * Role</summary><br><b>

Task – a call to a specific Ansible module
Module – the actual unit of code executed by Ansible on your own host or a remote host. Modules are indexed by category (database, file, network, …) and also referred as task plugins.

Play – One or more tasks executed on a given host(s)

Playbook – One or more plays. Each play can be executed on the same or different hosts

Role – Ansible roles allows you to group resources based on certain functionality/service such that they can be easily reused. In a role, you have directories for variables, defaults, files, templates, handlers, tasks, and metadata. You can then use the role by simply specifying it in your playbook.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which Ansible best practices are you familiar with? name at least three</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is an inventory file and how you define one?</summary><br><b>

An inventory file defines hosts and/or groups of hosts on which Ansible tasks executed upon.

An example of inventory file:

192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
192.168.1.4

[web_servers]
190.40.2.20
190.40.2.21
190.40.2.22
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is a dynamic inventory file? When you would use one?</summary><br><br>

A dynamic inventory file tracks hosts from one or more sources like cloud providers and CMDB systems.

You should use one when using external sources and especially when the hosts in your environment are being automatically<br>
spun up and shut down, without you tracking every change in these sources.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You want to run Ansible playbook only on specific minor version of your OS, how would you achieve that?</summary><br><b>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Write a task to create the directory ‘/tmp/new_directory’</summary><br><b>

```
- name: Create a new directory
  file:
      path: "/tmp/new_directory"
      state: directory
```
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What would be the result of the following play?</summary><br><b>

```
---
- name: Print information about my host
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: 'no'                                                                                                                                                                           
  tasks:
      - name: Print hostname
        debug:
            msg: "It's me, {{ ansible_hostname }}"
```

When given a written code, always inspect it thoroughly. If your answer is “this will fail” then you are right. We are using a fact (ansible_hostname), which is a gathered piece of information from the host we are running on. But in this case, we disabled facts gathering (gather_facts: no) so the variable would be undefined which will result in failure.

            src: system_info.j2 
            dest: /tmp/system_info
```

The content of the system_info.j2 template

```
# {{ ansible_managed }}
I'm {{ ansible_hostname }} and my operating system is {{ ansible_distribution }

<details>
<summary>The variable 'whoami' defined in the following places:

  * role defaults -> whoami: mario
  * extra vars (variables you pass to Ansible CLI with -e) -> whoami: toad
  * host facts -> whoami: luigi
  * inventory variables (doesn’t matter which type) -> whoami: browser

According to variable precedence, which one will be used?</summary><br><b>

The right answer is ‘toad’.

Variable precedence is about how variables override each other when they set in different locations. If you didn’t experience it so far I’m sure at some point you will, which makes it a useful topic to be aware of.

In the context of our question, the order will be extra vars (always override any other variable) -> host facts -> inventory variables -> role defaults (the weakest).

A full list can be found at the link above. Also, note there is a significant difference between Ansible 1.x and 2.x.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>For each of the following statements determine if it's true or false:

  * A module is a collection of tasks
  * It’s better to use shell or command instead of a specific module
  * Host facts override play variables
  * A role might include the following: vars, meta, and handlers
  * Dynamic inventory is generated by extracting information from external sources
  * It’s a best practice to use indention of 2 spaces instead of 4
  * ‘notify’ used to trigger handlers
  * This “hosts: all:!controllers” means ‘run only on controllers group hosts</summary><br><b>

#### :baby: Beginner

<details>
<summary>Can you explain what is Terraform? How it works?</summary><br><b>

Read [here](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html#what-is-terraform-)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What benefits infrastructure-as-code has?</summary><br><b>

- fully automated process of provisioning, modifying and deleting your infrastructure
- version control for your infrastructure which allows you to quickly rollback to previous versions
- validate infrastructure quality and stability with automated tests and code reviews
- makes infrastructure tasks less repetitive
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Why Terraform and not other technologies? (e.g. Ansible, Puppet, CloufFormation)</summary><br><b>

A common *wrong* answer is to say that Ansible and Puppet are configuration management tools
and Terraform is a provisioning tool. While technically true, it doesn't mean Ansible and Puppet can't
be used for provisioning infrastructure. Also, it doesn't explains why Terraform should be used over
CloudFormation if at all.

The benefits of Terraform over the other tools:
  * it follows the immutable infrastructure approach which has benefits like avoiding a configuration drift over time
  * Ansible and Puppet are more procedural (you mention what to execute in each step) and Terraform is declartive since you describe the overall desired state and not per resource or task. You can give the example of going from 1 to 2 servers in each tool. In terrform you specify 2, in Ansible and puppet you have to only provision 1 additional server
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain what the following commands do:

  * <code>terraform init</code>
  * <code>terraform plan</code>
  * <code>terraform apply</code>
</summary><br><b>

<code>terraform init</code> scans your code to figure which providers are you using and download them.
<code>terraform plan</code> will let you see what terraform is about to do before actually doing it.
<code>terraform apply</code> will provision the resources specified in the .tf files.
</b></details>

## Docker

<a name="docker-beginner"></a>

#### :baby: beginner

<details>
<summary>How containers are different from VMs?</summary><br><b>

The primary difference between containers and VMs is that containers allow you to virtualize
multiple workloads on the operating system while in the case of VMs the hardware is being virtualized to
run multiple machines each with its own OS.
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>In which scenarios would you use containers and in which you would prefer to use VMs?</summary><br><b>

You should choose VMs when:
  * you need run an application which requires all the resources and functionalilies of an OS
  * you need full isolation and security

You should choose containers when:
  * you need a lightweight solution that quickly starts
  * Running multiple versions or instances of a single application
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when you run `docker run hello-world`?</summary><br><b>

Docker CLI passes your request to Docker daemon.
Docker daemon downloads the image from Docker Hub
Docker daemon creates a new container by using the image it downloaded
Docker daemon redirects output from container to Docker CLI which redirects it to the standard output
</b></details>

Docker Cloud is built on top of the Docker Hub so Docker Cloud provides
you with more options/features compared to Docker Hub. One example is
Swarm management which means you can create new swarms in Docker Cloud.

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git fetch</code>?</summary><br><b>

Shortly, git pull = git fetch + git merge

When you run git pull, it gets all the changes from the remote or central
repository and attaches it to your corresponding branch in your local reposistory.

git fetch gets all the changes from the remote repository, stores the changes in
a separate branch in your local repository
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Explain the following: <code>git directory</code>, <code>working directory</code> and <code>staging area</code></summary><br><b>

The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging area is a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. It’s sometimes referred to as the index, but it’s becoming standard to refer to it as the staging area.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>How to resolve git merge conflicts?</summary><br><b>

<p>
First, you open the files which are in conflict and identify what are the conflicts.
Next, based on what is accepted in your company or team, you either discuss with your
colleagues on the conflicts or resolve them by yourself
After resolving the conflicts, you add the files with `git add <file_name>`
Finally, you run `git rebase --continue`
</p>
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between <code>git reset</code> and <code>git revert</code>?</summary><br><b>

<p>

`git revert` creates a new commit which undoes the changes from last commit.

`git reset` depends on the usage, can modify the index or change the commit which the branch head
is currently pointing at.

  * Simplicity 
  * Fast compile times
  * Built-in concurrency
  * Garbage collected
