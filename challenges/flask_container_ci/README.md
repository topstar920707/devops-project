Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves fixing the app in this directory, containerize it and set up a CI for it.
Please read carefully all the instructions.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv challenge_venv`
2. Activate it with `source challenge_venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the requirements in this directory `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the app

If any of the following steps is not working, it is expected from you to fix them

1. Move to `challenges/flask_container_ci` directory, if you are not already there
1. Run `export FLASK_APP=app/main.py`
1. To run the app execute `flask run`. If it doesn't works, fix it
3. Access `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see the following

```
{
    "resources_uris": {
        "user": "/users/<username>",
        "users": "/users"
    },
    "current_uri": "/"
}
```

4. You should be able to access any of the resources and get the following data:

* /users - all users data 
* /users/<username> - data on the specific chosen user

5. When accessing /users, the data returned should not include the id of the user, only its name and description. Also, the data should be ordered by users names.

## Containers

Using Docker or Podman, containerize the flask app so users can run the following two commands:

```
docker build -t app:latest /path/to/Dockerfile
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 app
```

1. You can use any image base you would like
2. Containerize only what you need for running the application, nothing else.

## CI

Great, now that we have a working app and also can run it in a container, let's set up a CI for it so it won't break again in the future
In current directory you have a file called tests.py which includes the tests for the app. What is expected from you is:

1. The CI should run the app tests. You are free to choose whatever CI system or service you prefer. Use `python tests.py` for running the tests.
2. There should be some kind of test for the Dockerfile you wrote
3. Add additional unit test (or another level of tests) for testing the app

### Guidelines 

* Except the app functionality, you can change whatever you want - structure, tooling, libraries, ... If possible add `notes.md` file which explains reasons, logic, thoughts and anything else you would like to share
* The CI part should include the source code for the pipeline definition
